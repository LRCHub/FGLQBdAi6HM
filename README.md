# BEAT CRUSADERS – CLOWN FOR THE DAY

> **歌詞登録ステータス：プレーン歌詞のみ**

```
"Adieu!
Honey, don't make me blue
Honey, don't make a fool
Of what you see and what you hear"

So poor
That was every word she said
Mama leaving home away
Like there was nothing for all those years

Daddy phones everyone in a town
(Where would you go?)
Don't know how many people around
(Where would you go?)
He's in the guise
Everyone smiles
Hit the party all day

Papa's got been a clown for the day
Mama's only one we lose
Papa's got been a clown for the day
Mama's only one we lose
Took so long I find the truth

Baby,
Do you think I was crazy?
Do you think I was silly?
Would you get to come close to me?
Hold me now
